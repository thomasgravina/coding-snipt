============

In this repos are some scripts I needed and coded by myself for fun.

You will find some <a href="https://github.com/thomasgravina/coding-snipt/tree/dev/javascript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thomasgravina/coding-snipt/tree/dev/shell">Script Shell</a>, Java...

They were/are really useful to me, but it's your responsability to use them ;)
